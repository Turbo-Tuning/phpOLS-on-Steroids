# phpOLS-on-Steroids

WinOLS is the no. 1 tool of choice for ECU tuning. Other tools have tried different approaches. This project aims to be a best-in-breed, taking the best ideas from each solution and develop a web-based OLS.

I already have over 25k lines of code written and will start to publish my work progresively in order to build a self-contained state-of-the-art ECU bin file editor.

Contributors welcome. Feel free to write to me.
